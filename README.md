This is an example of using CoreML and Vision to take a live camera feed and predict the object in frame. You will need to download the inceptionv3 mlmodel from Apple to use this App, or you can use your own keras of caffe model and convert those to an mlmodel.
This app does not currently work, I am trying to fix the current error which is that the network can recognize objects but the CoreML model does not give the correct prediction.
